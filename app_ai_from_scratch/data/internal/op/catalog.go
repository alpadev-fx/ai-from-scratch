// catalog is the whole surface of /data.
//
// HOW TO ADD ONE
// Declare it here, run `data verify`, and read what it says. The gate refuses a
// star, an undeclared table, a jamas column on an agent operation, an unbounded
// parameter, a scoped read with no actor filter, and a caller-supplied parameter
// that names a person. If it passes all of that, the operation is safe in the
// ways this service can check; the parts it cannot check are whether the query
// is correct and whether it is fast.
//
// WHAT IS DELIBERATELY MISSING
// There is no `sql.run`, no `table.select`, no operation taking a table name or
// a column list as a parameter. Every one of those would move the decision about
// what may be read from this file to the caller, and the caller is the thing
// being isolated from.
//
// Runtime api and api-worker have completed the cutover. db.ts and seed.ts are
// retained only by the one-shot init image; the runtime boundary gate prevents
// a pool, SQL literal or DATABASE_URL reference from returning to api/src.
