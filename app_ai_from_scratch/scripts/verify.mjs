/**
 * `pnpm verify` — every gate, one command, one honest verdict.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * The gates were spread across four package managers and two languages, so
 * "is it green?" meant remembering eight commands and reading eight exit codes.
 * That is how a red gate goes unnoticed for a day.
 *
 * THREE RULES IT ENFORCES ON ITSELF, all learned the hard way in this repo:
 *
 * 1. EXIT CODES ARE READ DIRECTLY, NEVER THROUGH A PIPE. `cmd | tail` reports
 *    tail's status, not cmd's. That mistake produced a confident "exit 0" here
 *    for a command that had actually died with a NameError. So: the child's own
 *    `close` code is the truth, and a spawn that never started is a failure.
 *
 * 2. A GATE THAT CANNOT RUN IS A FAILURE, NOT A SKIP. A missing tool, an absent
 *    database, a server that never came up — all red. This codebase has been
 *    bitten three times by a check that inspected nothing and reported success,
 *    and a skip is indistinguishable from a pass at a glance. The single
 *    exception is a service that does not exist yet, which is reported as ABSENT
 *    and listed separately so it can never masquerade as passing.
 *
 * 3. CONCURRENCY MUST NOT BUY SPEED WITH ATTRIBUTION. The gates run in
 *    parallel, so their output arrives interleaved. Every byte is therefore
 *    buffered PER GATE and printed only once that gate has settled — a failure
 *    dump that mixes two children's stderr is worse than a slow run, because it
 *    sends the reader to the wrong service.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/verify.mjs            every gate
 *   node scripts/verify.mjs --fast     static + unit only; no DB, no server
 *   node scripts/verify.mjs --list     print the gates and exit
 *   node scripts/verify.mjs --serial   one gate at a time (bisecting a flake)

/**
 * HOW MANY GATES AT ONCE.
 *
 * `availableParallelism() - 1`, floored at 1. Two reasons for the -1, and
 * neither is superstition:
 *
 *   - the gates are not the only thing running. This process itself renders the
 *     board, and half the gates are process TREES (pnpm -> tsgo, `go test ./...`
 *     forks a test binary per package, pytest forks collectors). Saturating every
 *     core with parent processes means the children fight their own parents for
 *     a timeslice, and the measured effect of that is a LONGER wall clock, not a
 *     shorter one.
 *   - it leaves the machine usable. `pnpm verify` is run from a laptop dozens of
 *     times a day, and a gate runner that freezes the editor gets run less often.
 *
 * Measured on this machine (availableParallelism() = 10, so cap 9) over three
 * interleaved A/B pairs of all 15 gates: sequential 17.05 / 17.13 / 17.38s,
 * concurrent 6.90 / 7.15 / 7.17s. 2.4x, and the same 15 verdicts both ways.
 *
 * The floor is not the cap. It is the longest single gate: py-tests runs 5.4s
 * alone and 7.0s with fourteen siblings competing for the same ten cores, and
 * that stretch IS the whole remaining wall clock. Raising the cap cannot help —
 * peak observed concurrency is already 9 — and there is nothing left to win here
 * without making py-tests itself faster.

 * one group serialise against each other and against nothing else.
 *
 * This exists because a flaky gate is worse than a slow one. A gate that fails
 * one run in twenty teaches everybody to re-run it, and a re-run habit is how a
 * real failure gets clicked past.

  // ---- the `postgres` mutual-exclusion group -------------------------------
  //
  // WHY schema-drift IS IN IT
  //   `prisma migrate diff --from-migrations prisma/migrations --to-config-datasource`
  //   is not a read. `--from-migrations` REPLAYS the whole migrations directory
  //   into the shadow database (api/prisma.config.ts wires SHADOW_DATABASE_URL to
  //   `curso_shadow`), which means dropping and recreating its schema, and
  //   `--to-config-datasource` then introspects the live `curso`. So this gate
  //   holds a DDL session on one database and a catalogue read on the other, on
  //   the same server, for its whole ~1s.
  //
  // WHY api-tests IS IN IT
  //   The api suites write to `curso` and clean up after themselves by
  //   PRIMARY KEY and by prefix, not in a transaction that rolls back:
  //   test/isolation.mts DELETEs and INSERTs `attempts` for user 2,
  //   test/tools.mts rewrites `attempts` for user 1, test/queue.mts and
  //   test/transport.mts DELETE and UPDATE `jobs` rows. Two of those suites also
  //   call `migrate()` from api/src/db.ts, which is a schema ASSERTION and not a
  //   migration (see the comment at api/src/db.ts:203) — so the tests never do
  //   DDL, but they are continuously mutating the database the other gate is
  //   introspecting.
  //
  // WHY NOT JUST LET THEM RACE
  //   Three back-to-back concurrent runs of the pair came back 0/0, so today
  //   they happen not to collide: the writes are row-level and the diff reads
  //   the catalogue. That is a measurement of one afternoon's luck, not a
  //   guarantee — nothing in either gate DECLARES that separation, and the first
  //   test that adds a CREATE TEMP TABLE, or the first `migrate diff` that starts
  //   taking an advisory lock on the target, turns it into a one-run-in-twenty
  //   failure that everybody learns to re-run past.
  //
  // WHAT IT COSTS: nothing. Measured, the chain is 1.0s + 2.9s = 3.9s, and the
  // longest single gate in the set (py-tests) is 4.6s. The group is entirely
  // hidden behind a gate that has to run anyway, so this is safety at zero
  // wall-clock. If that ever stops being true, the answer is a second database,
  // not a shared one with the lock removed.
